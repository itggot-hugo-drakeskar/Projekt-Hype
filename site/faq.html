          How do you write songs? What's your method? <br> <br>
          On this record in particular, I wrote everything, so obviously I just write it in the key that's comfortable for me to sing it. That's one of the things about going back to my old, old songs (Never Gonna Give You Up, etc.) - they always used to push me so hard to reach the notes anyway, because it makes for a more exciting vocal. But I never sing them in that key anymore anyway, because I'm 50 for fuck's sake.

          Have you ever felt limited being a baritone in a tenors world? What is your song selection process like? I'm a baritone and find it frustrating. However, we are in good company with the likes of yourself, David Byrne, and Paul Buchanan to name a few of my favourites. <br> <br>
          To be honest, I don't love the fact that male vocals are dominated by high pitched guys. Some of which are incredible, but for me it gets a bit whiny at time. hahaha
